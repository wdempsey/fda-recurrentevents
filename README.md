# Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional covariates via random subsampling  #
Code for combining functional data analysis (FDA) with random subsampling methods for fast fitting of recurrent event models in the presence of functional covariates (i.e., real-time sensor-based measures)

## Project Description ##
This project includes the code needed to reproduce the results in the paper: "Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional covariates via random subsampling". If using this code please cite the paper using the following bibtex: 

```tex
@InProceedings{Dempsey:2019,
author = {Dempsey, Walter},
title = {Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional covariates via random subsampling},
booktitle = {Best Journal},
year = {2019}}
```

The goal of this project is to do. 

## Code Description ##

If there are steps to run the code list them as follows: 

0. Dependencies. If there are any dependencies list them. 
1. Get the data
* Where is the data, who is in charge of it, how do they get it. 
* Are there preprocessing steps? If so what folder are they in, for example: [the data preprocessing directory](/data_preprocessing)
2. Run methods. Point people towards the folder with methods. [the methods directory](/methods)
3. Evaluate. Point people towards the folder with evaluation functions [the evaluation directory](/evaluation)

SOMETHING TO NOTE: Readmes are incredibly sensitive to spaces, if you are not sure why something isn't working double check the example and make sure you have the spacing right. 

Here is an example code block:

```
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=classpath.out
```
