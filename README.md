# Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional covariates via random subsampling  #
Code for combining functional data analysis (FDA) with random
subsampling methods for fast fitting of recurrent event models in the
presence of functional covariates (i.e., real-time sensor-based
measures)

## Project Description ##
This project includes the code needed to reproduce the results in the
paper: "Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional
covariates via random subsampling". If using this code please cite the
paper using the following bibtex:

```tex
@InProceedings{Dempsey:2019,
author = {Dempsey, Walter},
title = {Recurrent event analysis in the presence of functional covariates via random subsampling},
year = {2019}}
```

The goal of this project is to do. 

## Code Description ##

If there are steps to run the code list them as follows: 

0. **Dependencies**: All code is written in R. The code was run on the
   research computing system managed by SLURM.
1. **Data**: Data is from 91 suicidal-inpatients at Franciscan Children's Hospital
* Data is stored on Harvard's Sharepoint system; access to data is
managed by [Evan Kleiman]{}
* Two types of pre-processingSubsampling routine
Are there preprocessing steps? If so what folder are they in, for
example: [the data preprocessing directory](/data_preprocessing)
2. **Data visualization**:
* Gener
3. **Methods**:
*
4. **Evaluate**
* Code to evaluate method on simulation studies [simulation subdirectory](/evaluation/simulationstudies)
* Code to evaluate method on Franciscan dataset [case study subdirectory](/evaluation/casestudy)
5. **Write-up**
* Corresponding statistical writeup can be found in
2. Run methods. Point people towards the folder with methods. [the methods directory](/methods)
