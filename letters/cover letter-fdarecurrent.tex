\opening{Dear Drs. Jones and Liang:}

Kindly find enclosed the revised version of the manuscript ID JCGS-22-236, "Recurrent event analysis in the presence of real-time high frequency data via random subsampling."   We have revised the article to address the refereesâ€™ requests.  The reports called for a major revision to include related work on modeling event data with functional data predictors as well as historical functional linear models, include empirical evidence and associated discussion of the computational benefits of our proposal, as well as clarify several technical details in the theoretical sections and provide important intuition/sketches of the proofs. The new version complies with these requests.

We believe the work presents an important advance that gives researchers a simple tool to analyze recurrent event data in the presence of high-frequency sensors data.  Attached please find a detailed response to the referees outlining how the changes to the manuscript address the concerns raised in their reports.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
